We want to make the lending process better, reduce default risk, and increase profitability for lenders.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit learn


Project 3: Technical Stock Analysis of FAANG Companies
Description: The comprehensive portfolio analysis dashboard evaluates the dynamics of FAANG stocks (Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet) through a dual-layered approach. The first dashboard provides an overarching view of daily market movers, liquidity patterns, and long-term portfolio trends, offering investors strategic insights for navigating the ever-evolving tech landscape. Meanwhile, the second dashboard delves into the intricacies of technical analysis, employing indicators like OBV, MACD, AD, and RSI to uncover nuanced details on momentum, volatility, and trends. Through visualizations such as candle charts, MACD overlays, and volume indicators, investors can decipher market signals, empowering them to make informed decisions. The combined information from both dashboards equips users with a holistic understanding of FAANG stocks, enabling strategic investment decisions in an ever-changing financial landscape.

Technologies Used: SQL, Google Cloud, Vertex AI, Tableau
