### Problem Definition:

The project aims to develop a dynamic dashboard for traders and asset managers focusing on FAANG stocks (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) over the past decade. This interactive tool integrates stock prices and technical indicators to aid in trend identification. By leveraging historical trading data, the dashboard offers real-time insights for traders to visualize patterns and identify potential trading opportunities. The tool is designed to be a decision support system for enhancing trading strategies in the complexities of the stock market.

The analysis encompasses financial metrics, technical indicators, and portfolio value trends, providing insights into market behavior and potential investment opportunities.

The comprehensive portfolio analysis dashboard employs a dual-layered approach. The first dashboard offers an overview of daily market movers, liquidity patterns, and long-term portfolio trends, while the second delves into technical analysis, using indicators like OBV, MACD, AD, and RSI.
